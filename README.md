# Organyz
A free and open source file organizer for Windows.

This is Sarthak Ganguly. The dev space is really lonely right now. So if you are interested to contribute code, you are more than welcome. 

What is [Organyz](http://www.thecodepost.org/software/one-click-file-organizer-check-organyz/)?
If you have used the Internet and downloaded stuff to your local 'Downloads' folder, you know how it becomes in a few days if not weeks or months. There are every kind of file there. There are music files, movies, documents, ticket pdfs, images of your ex-es, and so on.

Organizing them is a pain. True, the 'group by type' in Windows Explorer and similar ones for Linux does fix things a bit but even that does not help much. For instance XLSX and XLX are clubbed under two different categories. JPG, BMP, PNG etc all get different categories. Organyz helps keep ANY folder organized by creating folders for their respective types. For instance - all document files will go to the Document folder. This includes the latest docx, the older doc, pdf - all of them. All images will be put in a Images folder. Same for videos and audio. It will be customizable too - will be adding that feature in too. 

In short, it simplifies and automates the organizing process. It saves time. And it is safe. No file is deleted. Ever.

Try Organyz now. And let me know if you wish to join.

Thanks,

Sarthak Ganguly
